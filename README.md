# EDEXO-Compare

Companion app for Elite Dangerous that predicts the exobiology on a planet from an FSS scan alone.

It reads your local journal folder, merges every `Journal.*.log` into one picture of the galaxy you
have visited, and — for any body with a biological signal — narrows the codex down to the species
that can actually live there, with payout ranges, first-footfall tracking, a system map and a
species encyclopedia.

Made by Bahuckel (CMDR FALrenica). Not affiliated with Frontier Developments.

This branch adds a **macOS / CrossOver port**, with browser and Electron releases
and no HUD overlays. See [macOS setup and builds](#macos--crossover-local-port).
The original project's download links below are upstream Windows/Linux releases;
there is no published Mac download yet. Our integration branch is `macos`; `main`
tracks the original repository. Contributors and agents should follow
[the branch and integration workflow](AGENTS.md).

## Download

Windows x64, no installer. Nothing is written to Program Files and nothing is registered with
Windows; everything the app saves lives in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ED Exo Compare\`.

| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **[Portable — one file](https://github.com/bahuckel/EDEXO-Compare/releases/download/v1.2.8/EDExoCompare.exe)** | Download and run. Unpacks itself somewhere temporary each time.       |
| **[Program folder — .zip](https://github.com/bahuckel/EDEXO-Compare/releases/tag/v1.2.8-zip)**                 | Extract and keep. Starts faster, and includes the two console builds. |

Both are the same version and the same code — [all releases](https://github.com/bahuckel/EDEXO-Compare/releases).

Windows will say the publisher is unrecognised: the executable is signed, but with a self-signed
certificate that SmartScreen does not trust. "More info" → "Run anyway".

### Linux — ![Untested](https://img.shields.io/badge/Linux-untested-orange)

**First Linux release, not yet tried on a real Linux desktop with the game running.** It starts,
finds a Proton journal folder and serves the app on Ubuntu 24.04; the HUD windows themselves have
not been seen over the game yet. If you try it, an issue saying what worked and what did not —
distro, desktop, X11 or Wayland — is the most useful thing you can send.

|                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **[AppImage — launcher + HUD](https://github.com/bahuckel/EDEXO-Compare/releases/download/v1.2.8-zip/EDExoCompare-1.2.8-x86_64.AppImage)** | The same app as on Windows: launcher window, tray, HUD overlays. One file, x86_64.                    |
| **[Browser build — .tar.gz](https://github.com/bahuckel/EDEXO-Compare/releases/download/v1.2.8-zip/EDExoCompare-1.2.8-linux-x64.tar.gz)**  | No Electron. The app and the HUD pages open in your browser. For anything the AppImage cannot run on. |

**AppImage:** `chmod +x EDExoCompare-1.2.8-x86_64.AppImage`, then run it. It needs FUSE 2:

| Distro                                           | Command                                |
| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Ubuntu 24.04+, Mint 22+, Debian 13+              | `sudo apt install libfuse2t64`         |
| Ubuntu 22.04, Mint 21, Pop!\_OS 22.04, Debian 12 | `sudo apt install libfuse2`            |
| Fedora, Nobara                                   | `sudo dnf install fuse-libs`           |
| Bazzite, Silverblue (read-only)                  | `rpm-ostree install fuse-libs`, reboot |
| openSUSE                                         | `sudo zypper install libfuse2`         |
| Arch, CachyOS, Manjaro                           | `sudo pacman -S --needed fuse2`        |

Without FUSE, `./EDExoCompare-1.2.8-x86_64.AppImage --appimage-extract-and-run` works too.

On start the launcher checks your desktop and lists anything the HUD needs that is missing, with the
install command for your distro: XWayland on a Wayland session, a compositor on a bare window
manager (the HUD is see-through only with one), the AppIndicator extension for the tray on GNOME.

**Browser build:** `tar xzf EDExoCompare-1.2.8-linux-x64.tar.gz`, then `./edexo-client.sh` in the
folder it makes. Its `README.txt` has the rest.

**Both:** the journals are found inside the game's Proton or Wine prefix — every Steam library
(native, Flatpak, Snap), Heroic and Lutris. Settings live in `~/.config/edexo-compare`. Run Elite
in **Borderless**: nothing can draw over an exclusive fullscreen game.

**Steam Deck:** in Gaming Mode the Deck's compositor (gamescope) shows one window, the game, so the
HUD windows cannot appear over it. Open the HUD in a browser on a phone or a second screen instead:
start the app in server mode (`./edexo-server.sh` in the browser build) and open
`/hud-overlay.html` at the address the launcher lists under **Network settings → LAN**. In Desktop
Mode it behaves like any Linux desktop.

## What it tells you

**Which body to fly to.** _Worth the trip?_ ranks every body in the system by expected value —
Σ chance × payout × first-footfall multiplier — alongside how many minutes on the ground it will
cost. Both timings are measured from your own journal, not guessed: approach and landing, and one
sampling run per genus.

**How likely each species is.** _Chance here_ is a calibrated probability, not a resemblance score.
It is built from how often a species has actually been recorded at this gravity, temperature,
pressure, planet class, atmosphere and host star, weighted by how common it is, and normalised
across the body's candidates. On bodies where every genus was sampled, rows it calls 90–100 % turn
up 97.8 % of the time.

**Which species, once you have mapped it.** After a DSS names the genus, the same posterior
renormalises inside that genus to say which of its species you are looking at.

**What you have not logged before.** A badge marks species new to your codex.

**What is left to find.** Achievements count every colour variant you have sampled, galaxy-wide and
region by region, with Bronze, Silver and Gold steps — plus stars, worlds and points of interest to
visit in each region. Track one and its plants are marked in the app and in the HUD.

**Where to go next.** The galaxy map (the galaxy icon in the top bar) draws all 5.3 million systems
with recorded biology in 3D, grouped by region, sector and neighbourhood, with your own systems on
top. Set a floor — _Worth ≥_ 50 M, say — and **Next target** flies to the nearest system above it that
you have not mapped or sampled, and copies its name to paste into the game's galaxy map; **Plan**
chains the next few, each the nearest to the last. Values there are the recorded species at 1×: those
systems come from other commanders' records, so first footfall is most likely gone. Without WebGL the
2D Classic map opens instead.

**Where it was wrong.** Every species you find that the app failed to offer is written to a local
miss log. That log is the reason recall went from 93.2 % to 97.1 %: it is read, not just recorded.

**On a second screen.** Open `?screen=triage` on a phone or tablet for a read-only triage view that
updates as you jump.

**Backups.** The launcher's Backups tile zips your journals, the app's own data (settings, on-foot
scans, surface marks, the miss log) and your exomastery and codex downloads — when you leave the game,
on a timer, or when you ask. Every backup is complete; unchanged files are copied from the one before,
so it stays quick. Choose a folder on another drive, a USB drive or a synced folder: the launcher warns
in red when the folder shares a partition with your journals, and in yellow when it shares the physical
drive. A restore never overwrites: app data goes back at the next start with the replaced files set
aside, and journals go into a folder you pick.

## Where the predictions come from

Two sources, and the app tells them apart.

The **codex rows** in `data/species/` say where a species should grow. A local corpus of ~39,000
real sightings says where it has grown. Where they disagree on a species the corpus has watched
enough times, **observation wins** — for host star, planet class, temperature, volcanism type,
gravity and atmosphere. Each of those six thresholds was swept against the app's own accuracy probe
before it shipped.

No number reaches the screen as a percentage unless the probe has calibrated it.

### The 5 % chance floor

Every candidate carries a **Chance here** figure — how often a species with this profile turns out to
actually be on a body like this one. It is the one percentage in the app that has been calibrated
against real outcomes: on bodies where every species is known, the 90-100 % band comes in at 97.8 %
and the 0-10 % band at 8.9 %.

Candidates below **5 %** are moved behind _show unlikely_ rather than listed. A row at 2.7 % beside a
row at 100 % is the model telling you it has already decided, and putting them on the same list asks
you to do that arithmetic again.

The floor never empties a panel — if nothing clears it, the single best candidate stays — never
touches a row the model has no opinion about, and never argues with a species you have scanned on
foot yourself.

To change it, edit `PRESENCE_FLOOR_PCT` in [`src/server/presenceFloors.ts`](src/server/presenceFloors.ts) and
rebuild. Measured against 378 species the author later confirmed on foot, a 5 % floor moved exactly
one of them behind _show unlikely_.

## EDSM

The app can look a system up on [EDSM](https://www.edsm.net/) so a system already in the community
database can be triaged before you arrive.

This is **off by default**, and it stays off until you enter your own EDSM API key from
[edsm.net/en/settings/api](https://www.edsm.net/en/settings/api) in **Options**. Turning it on sends
the name of each system you jump to to EDSM, at most once per system — asked the moment the FSD
starts its countdown, so the answer is waiting when you drop out of witchspace rather than arriving
after you have already read an empty panel. The key is stored on your
machine in its own file beside your settings, never in the settings file, and **Forget key** deletes
it and switches auto-fetch off.

## Canonn

The app can send your discoveries to [Canonn Research](https://canonn.science/), the community
science archive most of the exobiology knowledge in this project came from.

This is **off by default**. Turning it on sends organic scans, the sales that date them, codex
entries and whatever else Canonn is currently asking for — **with your CMDR name attached**, because
their archive is keyed on it, and with the journal line exactly as the game wrote it. There is no
anonymous form of it. Only live events go: switching it on never uploads journals you already have.

There is no telemetry and no analytics. Three requests run without a switch, and none carries
anything about you: the update check (each time the launcher opens, at most once an hour, GitHub is
asked for this project's releases; the app's version is in the user agent), the game server status,
and EDSM's answer to which systems on your plotted route it already knows (the system names only).
Every request is listed in the [privacy policy](public/legal/privacy.html), which ships with the app.

## Running it

### macOS / CrossOver (local port)

#### Run from source

Use Node 24 LTS, at least 24.15 (`.nvmrc` pins the major), and install the locked
dependencies with `npm ci`. Start Elite Dangerous in CrossOver before starting
this app; the port reads the journals the game writes inside its bottle.

```sh
npm ci
npm run build
npm run start:client           # browser UI at http://127.0.0.1:7111
```

For development, `npm run dev` runs Vite at port 5173 and the API at port 7111.
`npm run electron:dev:mac` builds and opens the native launcher, which can open
the main app in a browser or an Electron window.

#### Build local releases

Run packaging on a Mac. The default target is the build machine's architecture;
both scripts accept `--arch arm64` or `--arch x64`.

```sh
npm run dist:mac               # self-contained browser release for this Mac's architecture
npm run dist:mac -- --arch x64 # optional Intel release, built on macOS
npm run dist:mac:electron      # optional .app in dist/electron-out-mac
```

The browser release is under `dist/mac/` as a folder and `.tar.gz`. It embeds Node 24;
users do not need Node installed. Double-click `edexo-client.command` in the extracted
folder, and keep its Terminal window open; Ctrl+C stops the server. Settings and
backups are available at `http://127.0.0.1:7111/launcher.html`.

The Electron release is `dist/electron-out-mac/mac-arm64/EDExoCompare.app` on
Apple Silicon (`mac/EDExoCompare.app` for Intel). Open the `.app` to use the native
launcher. Both releases include the web app, species data, and SQLite WASM assets.
The browser release uses maintained `@yao-pkg/pkg` packaging; Electron uses its
own runtime and `electron-builder`.

#### Journals and settings

The default journal folder is:

```text
~/Library/Application Support/CrossOver/Bottles/Elite Dangerous/drive_c/users/crossover/Saved Games/Frontier Developments/Elite Dangerous
```

For a different bottle, use **Journal folder** in the launcher or set
`ED_JOURNAL_DIR="/absolute/path/to/journals"`. Settings live in
`~/Library/Application Support/ED Exo Compare`.

Journal selection takes precedence in this order: `ED_JOURNAL_DIR`, the saved
launcher selection, then the CrossOver default. The selected folder must contain
the game's `Journal.*.log` files. Journal updates are watched while the app runs;
`Status.json` continues to supply live main-app telemetry.

#### Supported behavior and limitations

The macOS experience excludes HUD overlays, their controls, and game-process/focus
checks. Journals and `Status.json` still update the main app. Automatic departure
backups rely on journal `Shutdown` events; crash/process-exit detection is excluded.
The launcher can still make manual and scheduled backups.

These are local test builds. Browser executables use ad-hoc signing; the Electron
`.app` is not prepared for public distribution. Developer ID signing and notarization
should be configured before publishing a Mac download. Existing Windows/Linux
overlay functionality is retained for those platforms.

Apple Silicon browser and packaged Electron releases have passed automated smoke
tests and initial manual testing. Intel packaging is supported but has not been
validated on an Intel Mac. These builds retain the upstream version number;
they are local port artifacts, not an upstream release.

#### Verify changes

```sh
npm test
npm run typecheck              # client, server, and tests
npm run lint
npm run dist:mac
npm run test:e2e:mac            # requires installed Google Chrome; uses synthetic journals
npm run dist:mac:electron
npm run test:electron:mac       # currently targets the packaged arm64 app
```

The browser test extracts the archive into a temporary path with spaces and
checks live journal updates and HUD omission. The Electron smoke test checks the
launcher, main window, and clean shutdown using a temporary profile and journals.

### Windows / upstream development

The packaged app is a small launcher window; the app itself opens in your browser.

```
npm install
npm run dev            # Vite (5173) + API/WS (7111)
npm run electron:dev   # build, bundle and launch the Electron launcher
npm run dist:win       # portable .exe + CLI build into dist/
```

Point it at your journal folder from the launcher (**Journal folder**) if it is not in the default
`Saved Games\Frontier Developments\Elite Dangerous`.

### Ports and network modes

|                        | Binds            | Who can reach it                             |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run start:client` | `127.0.0.1:7111` | this PC only                                 |
| `npm run start:server` | `0.0.0.0:7111`   | this PC **and every device on your network** |

Server mode exists so you can put the app on a second monitor, a tablet or a phone. It also means
the mutating endpoints (settings, exobiology reset, which system you are viewing) are reachable from
the LAN, so every non-loopback client must present an **access key**:

- the key is minted on first server-mode launch and stored beside your user settings
  (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\ED Exo Compare\edexo-compare-lan-key.txt`);
- the launcher's **Network settings → LAN** links already carry it as `?k=…`; open one on a device
  and it stays paired for a year via a cookie;
- requests from this PC never need it, so nothing about the local experience changes;
- delete the key file to un-pair every device.

Pass `--local` (or `--host 127.0.0.1`) to bind to this PC only, and no key is used at all.

## Development

```
npm test               # vitest over the pure logic (matching, payouts, layout, cache encoding)
npm run lint
npm run typecheck      # client + shared, server, and tests
npm run typecheck:server
npm run typecheck:tests
npm run format
```

### Measuring it

Accuracy is a measurement, not an opinion. The probes run against your own journal cache and the
species database, and print both scenarios — FSS-only and post-DSS — because a number for one of
them alone does not count.

```
npm run probe          # recall, ambiguity, precision, decidability, missing gate
npm run rank-probe     # mean rank, top-1, top-3, calibration buckets
npm run fixture        # regenerate the 20-body golden candidate fixture
```

`missing gate` is the one to watch: bodies where the app offers fewer candidates than the game
itself reports signals. It needs no ground truth to prove, and it should stay at zero.

### The feeder

The species profiles the model reads are built from a local corpus of Spansh exports hydrated
against EDSM. That corpus is a build input and is not in this repository.

```
npm run feeder -- status              # what the corpus holds vs what the app ships
npm run feeder -- import <file.csv>   # the one manual step
npm run feeder -- run [species...]    # hydrate, analyse, install
npm run feeder -- rebuild [species...] # rebuild profiles from packs on disk, no network
npm run feeder -- pack [species...]   # fold loose sample files into per-species archives
```

`EDEXO_PERF=1` turns on the server-side performance log — timers, counters and payload sizes
reported every 30 s. It is a no-op otherwise, so it stays compiled in permanently:
`npm run dev:perf` or `npm run start:client:perf`.

## Layout

## Licence

Three parts, three licences:

- **Code — MIT.** See [LICENSE](LICENSE).
- **Data — [CC BY-NC-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/).** The `data/`
  folder and the data tables generated into the code: credit the sources, no commercial use, share
  alike. Part of it is derived from [EDAstro](https://edastro.com)'s content, which carries this
  licence, so the data carries it too. Details, and the EDAstro-derived files, in
  [`data/LICENSE-DATA.txt`](data/LICENSE-DATA.txt). Releases 1.1.0–1.2.8 shipped those files under
  the MIT notice by mistake; the notice applies to them as well.
- **Photographs — Frontier's.** They are screenshots of Elite Dangerous; the game and its artwork
  belong to Frontier Developments and are under Frontier's terms, not either licence here.

If you use the code in something of your own, a credit and a link back — "based on EDEXO-Compare by
Bahuckel, https://bahuckel.com/projects/edexo-compare" — is appreciated; for the code it is a request,
not a term. For the data, credit is part of the licence.

**Every photograph in the app is labelled with where it came from**, and the label is the answer:

- **`Photo by Bahuckel — CMDR <name>`** — contributed. That commander took it themselves and gave it
  to this project knowingly: either the project owner's own, or a commander who photographed a
  species for the project or offered an existing shot in support of it. These are listed by file in
  [`data/species/photo-credits.json`](data/species/photo-credits.json).
- **`Photo from: https://ed-dsn.net/ and its respective owner`** — sourced from the
  [ED-DSN](https://ed-dsn.net) community. Here with ED-DSN's agreement while replacements are
  photographed, and the standing credit for anything not named in that manifest.

So a named commander under an image means its author agreed to it being here; the ED-DSN line is the
default, which is why an image can never quietly pass as contributed. Any rights holder who would
prefer theirs removed can ask and it will be, with no justification needed — see
[NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md).

Elite Dangerous, its artwork and game content remain the property of Frontier Developments; see
the [terms](public/legal/terms.html).
