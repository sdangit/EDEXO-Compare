/**
 * A full journal re-merge must never run twice at once.
 *
 * `resyncAllJournalFiles` starts with `store.resetAll()` and then spends roughly fifteen seconds
 * reading 271 logs back into that store. Two of them overlapping is not merely slow — the second
 * wipes what the first has built, and whichever finishes last saves the remains as a **complete**
 * cache. That is how the commander's 19,000-body history was written back as 215 bodies carrying a
 * single codex species, with the meta still claiming all 271 files merged.
 *
 * The watcher is where it started. A rotation sends `pulse` into a resync; the interval keeps
 * firing; `currentPath` is already the new file so later pulses skip the rotation branch and fall
 * into the `identity !== lastListIdentity` branch instead — stale, because that is only updated
 * once the first resync returns — and each starts a resync of its own. It was always possible. A
 * poll of 500 ms against a 15 s merge made it near-certain, because that ratio is how many pile up.
 *
 * Both halves are tested here: the watcher must not re-enter, and the resync must serialise itself
 * for the callers that are not the watcher at all (`restartJournalPipeline`, a journal-folder
 * change), which a guard living only in the watcher would leave free to collide.
