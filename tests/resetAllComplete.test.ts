/**
 * `resetAll` (a journal re-read, a rotation) leaves no journal state behind (plan 2.4, O-19). It
 * missed `commanderFid` and `lastJumpTarget`, so a re-read could keep a commander id or a jump
 * target from the history it had just thrown away. This compares every field against a fresh store,
 * so the next field someone adds and forgets is caught too.
