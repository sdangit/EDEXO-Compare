## Standing on other people's work

This project would not exist without five communities, none of which are affiliated with it and none
of which have endorsed it.

### Spansh — [spansh.co.uk](https://spansh.co.uk)

The reason this project was started. Spansh's exobiology search showed that "which species can live
on this body" is a question data can answer, and its route exports are the corpus every prediction in
this app is measured against — 47,983 confirmed sightings across 13,789 bodies at the time of
writing. Every calibration figure quoted in the README traces back to a Spansh export. The list of
systems Frontier populated, which the app ships to tell the Bubble from player colonies, comes from
Spansh's system search (`is_colonised`); `scripts/build-developer-systems.mjs` rebuilds it.

### EDSM — [edsm.net](https://edsm.net)

Body records: gravity, temperature, pressure, atmosphere, volcanism and orbital geometry for the
bodies in the corpus, plus the system coordinates that place them. Queried through the public API at
one request per 1.5 s and cached, so a re-run costs EDSM nothing.

Codex data provided by EDSM: `data/codex/edsm-codex-regions.json` (the Encyclopedia's Codex map) is
drawn from EDSM's nightly codex dump (16.2 million sightings, 2018–2026) — per galactic region, a few
systems covering every codex entry EDSM has there, with the entries it has for each. The same dump,
matched against Spansh's bodies, is how the plant colour rules were checked on 119,657 bodies.
`data/rarity/species-rarity.json` is from the same dump: per species, how many systems EDSM's codex
has it in, galaxy-wide and per region — the rarity tiers and the region check read it.

### EDAstro — [edastro.com](https://edastro.com), by CMDR Orvidius

EDAstro's content is licensed under [CC BY-NC-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/).
Part of this project's data is derived from it, which is why the project's data carries the same
licence ([`data/LICENSE-DATA.txt`](data/LICENSE-DATA.txt)). The EDAstro-derived files:

- `data/exomastery/region-species.json` — how often each species is recorded per region, from
  EDAstro's `codex-data.csv`;
- `data/exomastery/sector-map.json` — sector names from EDAstro's sector list;
- `data/exomastery/spatial-catalogue.json` — nebula coordinates (`nebulae-coordinates.csv`) and
  Guardian sites (`edsmPOI.csv`);
- `data/rarity/extra/edastro-codex-*.json` — the species–system pairs EDSM's dump does not have,
  added to the rarity counts;
- `data/rarity/body-share.json` — the rarity tiers, from the Spansh galaxy dump's bodies with EDSM's
  and EDAstro's codex;
- `src/shared/nspModelData.ts` — region and star-type averages for the phenomena prediction;
- `data/galaxy/bio-index.bin` — the galaxy map's index of systems with recorded biology: the species
  EDAstro's `codex-data.csv` has in each system, joined with the systems Spansh's galaxy dump shows
  with biological signals (built for the release builds; not in this repository);
- `data/exomastery/genus-body-split.json` — per Sinuous Tubers and Brain Tree species, counts of
  planet type, volcanism, temperature band and atmosphere on the Spansh galaxy dump's bodies where
  EDSM's and EDAstro's codex log exactly one species of the genus in the system;
- `data/exomastery/genus-prior.json` — how often each genus is found on bodies of each planet type,
  signal count, atmosphere, temperature band, host star class and volcanism, counted from the DSS
  genus lists in the Spansh galaxy dump.

Releases 1.1.0 to 1.2.7 shipped these under the MIT notice by mistake; they were always under
CC BY-NC-SA 3.0. Data the app downloads from EDAstro on the user's machine (phenomena, carriers,
points of interest, galactic records) stays EDAstro's and is not part of any release.

### EDDN — the Elite Dangerous Data Network ([EDCD](https://github.com/EDCD/EDDN))

Species sightings that commanders' tools send to EDDN (organic scans and codex entries), recorded by
the owner's own listener and added to the corpus the species profiles are built from (2026-10-01:
4,743 sightings across 89 species). EDDN is a live stream for players to share game data with tools;
it carries no licence of its own. Thanks to every commander and tool author who uploads.

### Canonn Research Group — [canonn.science](https://canonn.science)

The community's accumulated knowledge of where exobiology grows: the genus and species conditions,
the gravity and temperature limits, the atmosphere and volcanism requirements. Where this app's own
observations disagree with the published conditions, the observation wins — but the published
conditions are where every gate started, and being able to disagree with something is a debt to
whoever wrote it down first.

### ED-DSN — [ed-dsn.net](https://ed-dsn.net)

The species photographs. Commanders flew to these places, landed, and photographed the organism, and
that is not a small thing to have done ninety-seven times.

The colour-variant tables in `data/species/eddsn-colour-variants.json` were transcribed from the same
site — which species reads its colour off the parent star and which off a material on the body, and
what each key maps to. Community knowledge rather than a proprietary dataset, and checked against
this commander's own journals before it was wired in, but ED-DSN is where it was read from and typing
several hundred rows by hand was the alternative.

Credited by link to the network rather than by commander name, at ED-DSN's request and ours: the
photographs were taken on an expedition years ago and a significant number of those commanders can no
longer be reached, so naming some and not others would be worse than naming none.

## Species photographs

`data/species/<genus>/<genus>_photos/` holds 185 images of Elite Dangerous exobiology (each also
present as a cropped card and thumbnail, so 555 files). **138 of them were contributed by commanders
of the Bahuckel clan and by the Stellar Exobiologists Guild**; the remaining 47 are sourced from the ED-DSN community, are **not covered by
this project's MIT licence** and are not this project's to sublicense.

### Telling them apart, in the app and on disk

**Every photograph the app displays carries a credit, and the credit says which of the two it is.**
There is no unlabelled image.

| what you see under the photograph                              | what it means                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`Photo by Bahuckel — CMDR <name>`**                          | Contributed. That commander took it themselves, in their own game, and gave it to this project knowingly — either the project owner's own, or a commander who photographed a species for the project or offered an existing shot in support of it. |
| **`Photo by Stellar Exobiologists Guild`**                     | Contributed by the guild, whose commanders took them in their own game and gave them to this project knowingly.                                                                                                                                    |
| **`Photo from: https://ed-dsn.net/ and its respective owner`** | Sourced from the ED-DSN community. Not this project's, not MIT, and here with ED-DSN's agreement while replacements are photographed.                                                                                                              |

A named commander under an image is therefore a positive statement about where it came from and that
its author agreed to it being here. The ED-DSN line is the standing default, applied to anything not
named in the manifest, so an image can never be silently treated as contributed.

The contributed photographs are listed in `data/species/photo-credits.json`, which names the
commander against each file:

| commander                                     | images |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Bahuckel — CMDR FALrenica (the project owner) | 125    |
| Bahuckel — CMDR PhoEniXDFA                    | 5      |
| Stellar Exobiologists Guild                   | 5      |

Each contributor took the photographs themselves and gave them to this project knowingly. That is
the difference from the ED-DSN set below, and it is the whole reason the manifest exists: an image
credited to the wrong person is the one mistake this area of the project cannot make.

These replace the ED-DSN images, which are there mainly as placeholders. Anything not listed in the
manifest is ED-DSN's and carries the standing credit below. **Once a species has a contributed
photograph, ED-DSN's of that same species is removed from the tree** — 49 were retired this way — so
the borrowed images shrink as contributed ones arrive. They are also **variant** photographs — the
exact colour a body grows — which is what lets a card show the plant you are about to walk up to
rather than one of its siblings.

Two rights sit in each image and neither belongs to this project:

- the game artwork, which is Frontier Developments';
- the capture itself, which belongs to the commander who took it.

### What has and has not been agreed

ED-DSN's owner was asked directly, told what the images are used for, and **agreed that this project
may keep them for now**, until replacements exist. That is the agreement of the network that
curates them, and it is what this project has.

It is deliberately not described as a licence. The photographs were taken on an expedition years ago
and a significant number of those commanders are no longer reachable, so most of the individual
authors have neither granted nor refused anything — and nobody else can grant it for them. The images
are therefore here with the curator's agreement and without the authors', which is stated plainly
rather than papered over.

### They are being replaced

ED-DSN and this project are organising an expedition to photograph each species afresh, with
commanders who agree up front that their images may be used here. Those images will replace the ones
in this folder. Until then these stand in.

**If any rights holder would prefer their image not be here, it will be removed on request** — open
an issue or contact the maintainer, and no justification is needed.
