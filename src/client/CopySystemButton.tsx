/**
 * Copy a system name to the clipboard.
 *
 * The last step of every routing answer this app gives: the commander reads a name here and types it
 * into the galaxy map. One component everywhere a system name is shown (owner, 2026-09-25), because a
 * copy control that looks and confirms differently in two places reads as two different features.
 *
 * An icon right after the name, not a "[copy]" at the end of the row: the players who asked found
 * the row-end text button unintuitive — the thing to copy and the control that copies it should sit
 * together. After a click the icon turns into a tick with a "Copied" tooltip for a moment.
 *
 * Confirmation is the whole point. A clipboard write is silent, so without it there is no way to
 * tell a successful copy from a click that missed — and the commander finds out by pasting nothing
 * into the galaxy map.
