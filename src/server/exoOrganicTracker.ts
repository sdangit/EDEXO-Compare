/**
 * Where things are around you on this body, in metres.
 *
 * **Not tied to a sample session.** It was, and that was wrong: the overlay only built a payload
 * while a species was being tracked, so a commander standing on a planet having just landed saw no
 * map at all — the owner reported exactly that. A radar answers "what is around me here", which is
 * a question about the rock, not about whichever plant is half-sampled. So it is built from the
 * live surface fix alone, and the distance rows above it keep their own gate.
 *
 * Done here rather than in the overlay because the overlay is a transparent HUD ticking every
 * 320 ms and should not be running spherical trigonometry; and because the latitudes are here.
 *
 * The flat-earth approximation is fine and worth saying out loud: over a few hundred metres on a
 * body thousands of kilometres across, treating a degree of latitude as a fixed number of metres is
 * wrong by far less than a marker is wide. The longitude term keeps its cos(lat) factor because
 * that one is not negligible — near a pole it is the difference between a map and a lie.
