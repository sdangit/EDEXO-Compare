/**
 * Sending discoveries to Canonn, if the commander asks for it.
 *
 * Canonn Research is the community's science archive: every exobiology rule this app predicts from
 * exists because commanders sent them their scans for years. Contributing back is the closest thing
 * this project has to paying for what it uses.
 *
 * ## What the commander gives up, said plainly
 *
 * Canonn's contract takes the **journal line verbatim** and the **commander's name** attached to it.
 * There is no anonymous form of it and no API key to scope it down — the endpoint is unauthenticated
 * and `cmdrName` is a field in the body. So this is off by default, and the option that turns it on
 * says what it sends in those words. Every other outbound feature in this project has been held to
 * the same rule, and this is the one where it matters most: the whole point of the project has been
 * that a commander's journals are theirs.
 *
 * ## What is sent, and who decides
 *
 * Not everything, and not our choice. Canonn publishes a **whitelist** of event shapes and the
 * client forwards only what matches, which is how their own plugin works and how they keep from
 * being sent a commander's whole flight log. On top of that they take three events by name —
 * `ScanOrganic`, `SellOrganicData` and `CodexEntry` — which are the exobiology ones and the reason
 * this exists at all.
 *
 * Read out of `canonn-science/EDMC-Canonn` (`canonn/whitelist.py`, `canonn/codex.py`,
 * `canonn/emitter.py`) rather than guessed. The `api.canonn.tech` CAPIv2 service the owner
 * originally named was retired in that plugin's 7.4.1 release and no longer answers at all; this is
 * where the data goes now.
 *
 * ## Being a good guest
 *
 * The same terms as the EDSM auto-fetch, for the same reason — somebody else's infrastructure:
 *
 * - **Live lines only.** The historical replay never reaches this, so switching it on does not
 *   upload four years of journals in one burst.
 * - **One request in flight**, with a floor between them.
 * - **Never blocks.** Nothing in the journal path waits on the network.
 * - **Silent failure, and no retry.** A rejected event is Canonn's business, not something to badger
 *   the commander about or the endpoint about twice.
