/**
 * Which body in this system is worth the trip — B1, the screen the app did not have.
 *
 * Everything above this in the queue existed to make one number trustworthy: the chance a species is
 * on a body. With that calibrated (§32.3), a body's worth is arithmetic:
 *
 *   expected value = Σ over the candidates   P(present) × list price × first-footfall multiplier
 *
 * The probabilities already sum to the biological signal count, so this is the value of sampling
 * everything down there, not the value of one lucky guess.
 *
 * **Time is measured where it could be measured, and left out where it could not.** From 244
 * journals: approach and landing take a median 1.2 minutes (299 landings, p25 0.9, p75 1.8), and
 * sampling one genus takes 2.5 minutes (264 runs, p25 1.9, p75 4.2). Supercruise is not here, and
 * that is deliberate — see {@link ON_SITE_ONLY}.
 *
 * ## The genus-level version was measured and REJECTED (§26.4)
 *
 * An earlier attempt ordered bodies by expected value computed from **genus** co-occurrence, before
 * the species-level model existed. It was built, measured, and refused: it read the system **4 M
 * credits low on average**, because a genus's value is not the value of the species actually on the
 * body and the error does not cancel. Sequencing mattered more than the idea — expected value only
 * became honest once {@link TriageCandidate.probability} was a calibrated *species* probability.
 *
 * If you are tempted to add a cheaper genus-only estimate for bodies the model cannot score: that is
 * the thing that was already tried. Leave such rows unscored and let `coverage` say so.

 * A9's "value at risk" — is this body's number solid, or is it a lottery ticket?
 *
 * Expected value is honest **in aggregate**: the probabilities sum to the biological signal count, so
 * a system's total is a fair expectation. What it cannot tell you is *what you are flying down for*.
 * A body showing 4 M because one 15 %-likely species is worth 25 M is a completely different
 * proposition from a body showing 4 M because four near-certain species are worth 1 M each — and the
 * triage table draws them identically.
 *
 * When most of the value rests on one unlikely candidate, the cheap move is to **map the body
 * first**. A DSS names the genus for the cost of a few probes, and §35's within-genus view then
 * answers the rest — far cheaper than landing, sampling, and finding the 1 M species instead of the
 * 25 M one.
 *
 * **The thresholds are definitions, not tuned parameters.** "Most of the value" means more than half
 * of it; "unlikely" means less likely than not. Neither is swept against the probe, because neither
 * is a claim about the world — they are what the two English words mean. The probability they are
 * applied to is the calibrated one (§32.3), and no new percentage reaches the UI (§18 rule 3).
 *
 * **The advice has to be actionable, which is a third condition.** A DSS names the *genus*. If every
 * candidate on the body is the same genus, mapping costs probes and tells the commander nothing they
 * did not already know — the question was always which *species* of that genus, and §35 answers that
 * after landing, not before. Honest note: measured on the current corpus this condition excludes
 * **none** of the bodies the other two flag, so it is a guard rather than a filter. It stays because
 * the alternative is advice that is true about the risk and useless as an instruction, and nothing
 * about the corpus guarantees the overlap stays empty.
 *
 * So the flag means: *most of this number rests on one unlikely species, and a map would tell you
 * whether it is there.*
 *
 * Measured on 1,091 bodies with a value: it fires on **38 (3.5 %)**, carrying **2.2 %** of the
 * corpus's expected value. Rare enough to mean something when it appears. The shape of a hit, from
 * that run:
 *
 *   Body 10 — 8.5 M expected, **63 % of it resting on Stratum cucumisis at 33 %**, while the
 *   likeliest species on the body is Bacterium cerbrus. Two different genera, so one DSS decides
