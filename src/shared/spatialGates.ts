/**
 * Spawn conditions that depend on where a system *is* — INCLUDE-BODY-IDS Phase 7.
 *
 * Three genera are gated on galactic position rather than on anything a body scan reports, and until
 * now the app could only say so and give up (`predictionUnsupported`). The catalogues exist, the
 * thresholds are measured, and this is the check.
 *
 * ## The thresholds are evidence, not choices
 *
 * From `EDSM-targz-to-db/docs/ABSTRACT-COND.md`, measured against edastro's `codex-data.csv`
 * (4.85 M rows, species-level) with controls:
 *
 * | gate | species | measured | control |
 * |---|---|---|---|
 * | nebula < 150 ly | Bark Mounds | 93 % of 23,651 systems | 4–7 % background |
 * | nebula < 150 ly | Electricae radialem | 79 % of 16,370 systems | *pluma 0 %* |
 * | Guardian site < 1,000 ly | Brain Trees | 99 % of 16,062 systems | 15–27 % |
 * | galactic core < 10,000 ly | Sinuous Tubers | 94 % of 5,139 systems | 0–20 % |
 *
 * Planetary nebulae are excluded from the catalogue on evidence: **not one** of 88 Bark Mound systems
 * had one as its nearest neighbour. That leaves 346 real + procgen points.
 *
 * ## Why this demotes rather than deletes
 *
 * The obvious move is a hard cut — outside the radius, remove the species. The measurements say not
 * to. Bark Mounds reach **100 % within 300 ly**, so a cut there loses nothing; but Electricae
 * radialem only reaches **82 % within 300 ly**, which means **roughly one radialem system in five is
 * further from a catalogued nebula than any threshold would allow**. Some of that is surely
 * catalogue incompleteness — procgen nebulae are not all listed — but a hard gate cannot tell the
 * difference between "no nebula here" and "no nebula *recorded* here", and it would silently delete
 * real sightings.
 *
 * So a failed gate marks the candidate **unlikely**, which is a tier the app already has and already
 * collapses behind "show unlikely (N)". It leaves the main list, it does not leave the app, and the
 * reader is told the distance and the rule. That is the no-walls rule kept while still answering the
 * question the commander actually asked.
 *
 * The other direction matters too: passing the gate is **not** evidence the species is present. It
 * removes an objection, nothing more.
