/**
 * Spawn conditions that depend on the host **star class**, measured rather than quoted.
 *
 * ## Why this is a module and not a field on the species row
 *
 * The species JSON already carries `conditions.parent_star` for Electricae pluma and Amphora, and
 * `conditions.parent_star_types` for Anemone. **None of the three is read.** `speciesTreeLoader`
 * looks for `parentStarTypeIncludesAnyOf` / `parentStarTypeIncludes` / `starTypeIncludes` and
 * nothing else, so those keys are dropped in silence — not evaluated, and not even flagged as
 * `predictionUnsupported` the way `location_requirement` is. Pluma has therefore never been gated on
 * its host star at all.
 *
 * Wiring the prose through would not have helped much either. It reads
 * `"A (luminosity class V or higher)"` and `"Neutron star"`, and the matcher compares codex
 * fragments against the journal's `StarType`, which spells those same stars `A` and `N`. Substring
 * matching one vocabulary against the other is what {@link hostStarClassKey} was written to stop.
 *
 * ## The evidence
 *
 * From `EDSM-targz-to-db/docs/ABSTRACT-COND.md` §3.7, measured 2026-09-06 across **10,194 pluma
 * sightings**: arrival stars are Neutron 46 %, White Dwarf 30 %, A 14 %, Black Hole 8 %. **O and B
 * came in at 0 %**, which refutes two of the four "to be confirmed" classes ed-dsn lists, so the
 * set is exactly {A, N, D, H} rather than the wider one the codex claims.
 *
 * Checked against our own corpus before being switched on, and the numbers are unusually clean:
 *
 * | measure | result |
 * |---|---|
 * | confirmed pluma sightings kept | **31 of 31** |
 * | corpus bodies matching the Electricae genus shape | 627 |
 * | …of those, hosts inside {A, N, D, H} | 36 (5.7 %) |
 * | …so pluma is withdrawn from | **591 bodies (94.3 %)**, losing nothing |
 *
 * ## Barycentres, which is what made this necessary
 *
 * A body orbiting a star *pair* has no star in its parents chain — only `{Null: n}` — and picking
 * one star out of the pair invents an answer. That is not hypothetical: the shipped pluma profile
 * records one `M3` host, and it comes from **Eok Blao ED-Q d6-351 BC 3 c**, a body orbiting the B+C
 * barycentre of an M dwarf and an L brown dwarf in a system whose primary is a *neutron star*. That
 * single mis-attributed row is what licensed pluma on every M-class body in the game, including the
 * owner's home system 175 ly from R Cra.
 *
 * `ABSTRACT-COND.md` §6.3 hit the same wall from the other side and states the rule: *"if the body
 * orbits a barycentre with no star in its parents chain, fall back to the letters of ALL stars in
 * the system (fixes 35 Anemone misses on star-pair barycentres)"*. So a gate is evaluated against a
 * **set** of classes, never a single one:
 *
 *  - every star in the body's own parents chain, which for a body orbiting a pair is both of them;
 *  - and when the chain names no star at all, every star in the system.
 *
 * Both readings are generous on purpose. The set only has to *intersect* the allowed classes, so a
 * body whose host is ambiguous keeps its candidate rather than losing it to a coin flip.
 *
 * ## What a failure means
 *
 * The same thing a failed spatial gate means: the row moves to the `unlikely` tier with its reason
 * attached, and stays visible behind "show unlikely". An empty class set — no star scanned yet —
 * returns null, never a failure.
