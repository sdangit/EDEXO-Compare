 * successful build Defender scans the 370 MB portable exe this script has just written, and a
 * rebuild started while that is still going fails on a `.pak` deep inside `win-unpacked`.
 *
 * That failure is expensive in a way an ordinary build error is not. The wipe runs **first**, so by
 * the time it gives up it has already deleted most of the previous build: the commander is left
 * with no exe at all, having had a working one a minute earlier. Waiting half a minute for a lock
 * that usually clears in five seconds is free; giving up early is not. Measured once in the field:
 * the same directory removed cleanly on the second attempt of a two-second loop, well after this
 * had abandoned it.
 *
 * The delay grows, so a lock that clears immediately still costs almost nothing.

Output: dist/electron-out/

- win-unpacked/ — unpacked tree; species JSON lives under win-unpacked/resources/data/species/<Genus>/
  Large exomastery packs: keep them under data/species/ in the repo, OR put the same tree under ./exomastery-overlay/ (or EDEXO_DATA_OVERLAY=path) so each build merges them into the pack — do not copy only into win-unpacked (rebuilds wipe it).

Localhost-only: run EDExoCompare.exe --local  (binds 127.0.0.1:7111).

Console-only builds: npm run dist:win:cli  → dist/cli-pack/EDExoCompare-*-CLI.exe

If something fails, check edexo-compare-startup-error.log or edexo-compare-crash.log next to the .exe.
