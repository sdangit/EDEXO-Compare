 * Start the thing we just built and wait for it to say it is listening.

 * The bundle can fail in ways nothing else sees: it is CJS, and `tsx`, `vitest` and `vite` all run
 * the same sources as ESM. `import.meta.url` is the clearest case — esbuild replaces `import.meta`
 * with an empty object in CJS output, so a module that resolves its own directory that way throws
 * *"The 'path' argument must be of type string or an instance of URL"* the moment it is imported.
 * That shipped, and the packaged app would not start, while every test and every dev run passed.
 *
 * Booting it once is the cheapest check that covers the whole class. `--no-smoke` skips it.
